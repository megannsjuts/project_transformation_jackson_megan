# Resources

* [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

I used this resource for the CSS code to visually hide the HTML headers used
only for screenreaders.

# Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

I am not sure that the links for the W3C Validator and HTML5 Outliner are
working correctly. I emailed about this, but had to move forward with
finishing the assignment. I will include screenshots of each of these when I
submit on Canvas.
